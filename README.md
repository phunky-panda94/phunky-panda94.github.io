# Welcome!

Hi there!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. 

Below of some web applications I've made that demonstrate the use of different front-end and back-end technologies, ranging from simple frontend applications to full-stack applications.

The main front-end technologies used include:

- JavaScript
- React
- HTML
- CSS

The main back-end technologies used include:

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- REST APIs

Heroku and Netlify have been used for deployment of these web applications.
